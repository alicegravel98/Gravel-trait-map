## Gravel-trait-map

This repository was created during the course of a master's project : Mapping foliar functional traits at the Station de Biologie des Laurentides using hyperspectral imagery.
These are the first scripts used to preprocess trait data and get familiar with R programming. Leaf-level spectra has also been processed and is available for use. Please feel free to contact me at alice.gravel@umontreal.ca for access to the data.
